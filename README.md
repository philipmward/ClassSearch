ClassSearch
===========

Searches through a list of classes and class data. Creates a user interface that allows a user to search for classes by type and where they are offered. It reads the classes at the start from an input file and then verifies that all information in the input file is valid. It reports if all info is in the valid format or not in the invalidInput.txt file. This was a school project from 2 years ago, as such it's slightly rough especially on the User Interface front since we were just learning how to build UI's, and the UI had to be fully built by hand coding. To run this it takes an argument of the input and output log files "input.txt invalidInput.txt"
